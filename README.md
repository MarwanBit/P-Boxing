# P-Boxing

This Project uses both Accelerometer Data and Video Data to classify Boxing Punches, the goal is to create a live Demo which 
Can classify boxing punches with a confidence score in real time.

(1) Accelerometer Data, to run the Accelerometer Data go into the Boxing_punches_classification folder and clone it,
than open the Jupyter Notebook named "[experimental]_boxing_FINAL". Running the cells in this file you should be left with an 
X_train and y_train arrays which can be used for training.

(2) To run the Video Data go into the Punch_DL folder and clone it, open the next folder named "code", and run the Jupyter Notebook
Named "data_loading". When running the cells make sure the working directory iws of the form "c:\ .... \ Punch_DL", than runnning the cells
you should be left with X_train and y_train arrays which can be used for training.

(3) These steps should work for getting the code up and running to the point where you can start to train some models and experiment with
all the cool ML that you would like to work on!
